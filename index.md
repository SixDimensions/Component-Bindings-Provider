# Hi Jeremy

So the authoring here is pretty simple, you can either use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) or HTML.  Either works.

You do have to make sure that the Jekyll YAML front matter is in place for this all to work.  This is placed above the markup and is denoted by the three dashes to begin and end.

[Go here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for the instructions on installing Jekyll.  This is pretty vanilla so it should be pretty easy.
