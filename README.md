Component Bindings Provider
=====================

This API is designed for use in the context of Adobe CQ/AEM.  It enables developers to bind properties to the page context of any CQ Component based on the resource type of the component.

This frees up component developers from writing Java code directly in their JSPs (scriptlet) for a cleaner, more maintainable development process.
